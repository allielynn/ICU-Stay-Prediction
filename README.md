# ICU-Stay-Prediction
Predicting ICU stay length using NLP on discharge summaries

## Approach:
- Developed a predictive model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to estimate ICU length of stay based on caregiver discharge notes from the MIMIC III dataset.
- Engineered text embeddings with BioBERT and applied Random Forest and Gradient Boosting regression models to capture complex relationships in clinical text.

## Findings:
- Achieved an $R^2$ of 0.5246, explaining 52.46% of ICU stay variability using only textual discharge summaries.
- Applying this methodology to intake summaries could enhance ICU capacity planning, provide insight for doctors on patient stay expectations, and assist patients in financial planning and decision-making.
