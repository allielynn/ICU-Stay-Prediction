# ICU-Stay-Prediction
Predicting ICU stay length using NLP on discharge summaries

- Developed a predictive model using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to estimate ICU length of stay based on caregiver discharge notes from the MIMIC III dataset.
- Engineered text embeddings with BioBERT and applied Random Forest and Gradient Boosting regression models, achieving an $R^2$ of 0.5246, explaining 52.46% of ICU stay variability from clinical text.
- Applying this methodology to intake summaries could enhance ICU capacity planning, provide insight for doctors on patient stay expectations, and assist patients in financial planning and decision-making.
